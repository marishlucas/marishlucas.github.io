This website was built on 11ty. 

All the styling is written in scss.

Everything else is vanilla javascript.

I wanted to build a brutalistic portofolio that showcased my work. 

Plain and simple. 

I didn't want to use any of the new javascript fluff, because added complexity wasn't needed.

Just organized, clean, vanilla webdev code.

Minimal design that doesn't distract.
