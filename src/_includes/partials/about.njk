      I'm a creative web developer and designer, building web solutions for
      businesses since 2022. I specialize in building visually pleasing and
      aesthetic web apps, from landing pages to full-stack web applications and
      e-commerce sites, all aimed at providing an excellent user experience. I
      stay flexible and continuously learn the latest technologies and
      frameworks, allowing me to tackle a wide range of projects, including web3
      and AI. My main focus, however, is on creating accessible web apps with
      clean, intuitive, and beautiful designs. If you like my work, feel free to
      shoot me a message down below!
